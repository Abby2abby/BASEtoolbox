# Bayesian Solution and Estimation (BASE) for HANK toolbox.

Toolbox for estimating medium-scale HANK models based on "Shocks, Frictions, and Inequality in US Business Cycles" by Christian Bayer, Benjamin Born and Ralph Luetticke ([link to paper](https://www.benjaminborn.de/publication/bbl_inequality_2020/)).

Note that the example setup of the toolbox does not replicate the results in the paper.

There is also currently an issue with MKL on macOS. Therefore, we use OpenBLAS for macOS machines. Note, that MKL offers considerable speed-ups.

To get started, clone or download the repository. The full documentation can be found locally in `docs/build`.
